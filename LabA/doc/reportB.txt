I've began to implement code generator. There are some modules I'm working on now:

CodeGenerator is a main entrance to the LLVM generation and linearisation
Builder contains building and linking functions.
Strings contains JVL tree traversal that returns a list of strings that
I'm declaring as global variables in the beginning of the LLVM file.
LLVMTypes contains LLVM Types.
LLVMSyntax contains syntax of a LLVM program.
Statements & Expressions contain Javalette tree traversal and linearization
to jvm assembly code that I'm changing with transformation to LLVM tree.

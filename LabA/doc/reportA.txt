* Typechecker takes a Javalette source file and returns "ERROR" if it contains type
errors and "OK" if it doesn't. 

* Javalette language is produced by BNF converter, q.v. BNFC source file JL.cf.

* The parser has one shift/reduce confict in the if-else statement. The statement is
described in the part of the grammar:

SIf.     Stm    ::= "if" "(" Exp ")" IfRest ;
IfR.     IfRest ::= Stm IfRestRest ;
IfRE.    IfRest ::= ";" ;
IfRREl.  IfRestRest ::= "else" Stm ;
IfRRE.   IfRestRest ::= ;

The parser has ambiguous situation when it reads an 'else' token as lookahead
element of the parsing process. It could either reduce to the rule IfR or shift
to the IfRREl.
